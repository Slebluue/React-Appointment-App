This is a simple calendar / appointment app in react only. To correctly make an entire app I would need a datebase of some sort. Currently I am using state to save calendar dates so refreshing your browser after the app is running will reset the appointments.

Another iteration would use a database to avoid that issue

## App Set Up
- Clone the repo
- `yarn install` or `npm install`
- `yarn start` or  `npm start`
- app starts on http://localhost:3000/
